  For R and S determinations and E/Z determinations, we need a means
  of scanning through the molecule.

  One of the underlying objects is a list of atomic numbers encountered.

  Sept 99. This is incorrect. Ran into a case (LLY 484066) where just
  keeping track of atomic numbers is not good enough, as that doesn't
  distinguish between a singly bonded and multiply bonded atom.

  For this reason, we reserve 4 slots for each atomic number.
    4 * z = single bond
    4 * z + 1 = aromatic bond
    4 * z + 2 = double bond
    4 * z + 3 = triple bond

  Also, I find that we must implement a set of Atomic_Numbers_Encounterd
  for each "layer" in the R/S determination. Otherwise we cannot distinguish
  between C-N and N-C

  Mar 2000. Still not right.
  We must account for the connectivity of the atoms encountered. John Tomer
  sent me examples of asymmetric norboranes that failed.

  For example

     C1CC2C=C(C1C2)C(O)=O PBCHM281894

  the path scoring runs around the ring and decided it is done. But, it
  hasn't realised that one of the bonds at the end of the double bond is
  3 connected, and the other is 2 connected.

  Therefore we need to take the connectivity into account. We allow
  up to 4 connections. Therefore, each atom needs 11 slots

    11 * z      = single_bond, 1 connection
    11 * z + 1  = single_bond, 2 connections
    11 * z + 2  = single_bond, 3 connections
    11 * z + 3  = single_bond, 4 connections
    11 * z + 4  = aromatic_bond, 2 connections
    11 * z + 5  = aromatic_bond, 3 connections
    11 * z + 6  = double_bond, 1 connections
    11 * z + 7  = double_bond, 2 connections
    11 * z + 8  = double_bond, 3 connections
    11 * z + 9  = triple_bond, 1 connections
    11 * z + 10 = triple_bond, 2 connections

    Aug 02. What if we try to do a chirality determination on a molecule
    that contains non-periodic table elements? Since these can be encountered
    by any kind of bond, we use a pseudo atomic number that is computed
    from the atomic symbol.

    Allow one number for each single letter element, one for each two letter element,
    and one for everything else
