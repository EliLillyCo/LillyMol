# Data
This directory holds data that has proven to be useful with LillyMol

There is a mixture of structure files used for unit tests and queries,
reactions, models and other structural information. Many of these
data files/directories will have an associated executable, and
a shell wrapper (in $LILLYMOL_HOME/contrib/bin) that sets up
the executable to use these files.
