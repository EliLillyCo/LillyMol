# random_geometric_transformations

This directory holds fragment libraries that can be used with random_geometric_transformations.sh

This is used by the scripts

* random_molecular_permutations.sh
* graph_edit_changes.sh

with each one using a different file of probabilities.

Generally this works well, the code needs to be modermised and more attention
paid to valence errors - which should be avoidable.
